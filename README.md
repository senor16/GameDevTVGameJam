### Post mortem:

I really loved working with Pico 8. Went using it, we really feel thatthe author put a tremendous effort while creating it.  
Some specific Pico 8 features (ADD() DELL() ALL() ...) really makes the difference, theexperience is very immersive,  
and when using the BBS store througt SPLORE, we really feel like we are using a game console connected to internet.
I'm not much into design or graphics, so the small screen size (128x128) made easy for me to craft something relatively descent.  
At anytime where I have the choice, I'll certainly prefer prototyping with the Pico 8 virtual machine.
